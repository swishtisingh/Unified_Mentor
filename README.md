# Unified Mentor (Data Analytics Internship) 


## Overview
During my data analytics internship, I conducted in-depth analysis on two datasets to derive meaningful insights. The primary focus was on exploring trends, distributions, correlations, and sector-wise comparisons across multiple financial years.

### Datasets
1. **Sales Data** :
   - Contains sales information, including region, country, item type, sales channel, order priority, order date, and financial metrics like units sold, unit price, total revenue, total cost, and total profit.

2. **Sector Investment Data**:
   - Includes investment data across different sectors.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis were:
- To identify trends and patterns in sales and investment data.
- To compare different sectors' performance over time.
- To explore correlations between various financial metrics.
- To visualize the distribution of investments and sales across different categories.

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Sales Data Analysis
- **Categorical Data Distribution**:
  - Generated bar plots to analyze the distribution of sales across different regions, item types, sales channels, and order priorities.
- **Time Series Analysis**:
  - Created line plots to observe trends in total revenue and units sold over time.
- **Correlation and Relationships**:
  - Constructed a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between financial metrics like unit price, units sold, total revenue, total cost, and total profit.
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - Used box plots and violin plots to compare total profit and total revenue across different item types and order priorities.

### 2. Sector Investment Data Analysis
- **Trend Analysis**:
  - Developed line plots to analyze investment trends over the years for each sector.
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - Utilized bar plots and stacked bar charts to compare investments across sectors for specific years.
- **Heatmap**:
  - Generated a heatmap to visualize the intensity of investments across sectors and years.
- **Distribution Analysis**:
  - Created box plots and violin plots to examine the distribution of investments across years and sectors.
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between investment values across different years.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Conclusion
1. Both online and offline sales channels have equal sales.
2. The sales data is divided into 07 regions.Sub-Saharan Africa has highesrt sales and North America has minimum sales.
3. 22% of the orders experienced cancellations.
4. More number of offline orders are being cancelled than the online orders. 
5. Delivery duration is not the main reason for cancelling the order.
6. Months of october and march have highest sales.

## Recommendations
Since more number of offline orders are being cancelled than the online orders it implies that there is some problem in offline stores. We can take the following measures to solve this issue:
1. Improve stock tracking and replenishment processes to ensure items are available when ordered.
2. Enhance communication with customers about stock availability and estimated delivery/pickup times.
3. Train staff to provide better customer service and create a more pleasant shopping environment.
4. Implement easy and customer-friendly return or exchange policies to reduce cancellations due to customer uncertainty.
5. Introduce promotions or loyalty programs that incentivize customers to complete their purchases rather than cancel them.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my mentors from Unified Mentor for their guidance and support throughout this internship.
